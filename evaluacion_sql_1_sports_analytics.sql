#  EJERCICIO 1ª EVALUACIÓN SQL. SPORTS ANALYTICS
-- ----------------------------------------------
/* ENUNCIADO
Desde la empresa Sports Analytics nos han enviado un conjunto de datos referentes a las clasificaciones de partidos de la NBA de los años 2016 - 2021.
Como parte de la entrevista técnica nos han pedido que hagamos una BBDD en SQL que contenga las siguente tablas.

De esta forma, nos han pedido lo siguiente:
   1. Crear una base de datos que contenga tres tablas distintas, que contengan los campos mostrados en los ejemplos anteriores.
	- Tabla season
	- Tabla teams
	- Tabla stats
	Donde la tabla stats será aquella que tenga referencias a las tablas seasons y teams. Todas las tablas deberán contener una clave primaria. */

	-- En primer lugar creamos el esquema y lo activamos.

	CREATE SCHEMA sports_analytics;
	USE sports_analytics;

	-- A continuación creamos las tablas con las todas las columnas, primary keys y foreign keys correspondientes.

	CREATE TABLE seasons (
		season_id BIGINT NOT NULL UNIQUE, 
		season VARCHAR(20) NOT NULL,
		PRIMARY KEY(season_id));
    
	CREATE TABLE teams (
		team_id BIGINT NOT NULL UNIQUE,
		team VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
		PRIMARY KEY (team_id));
    
	CREATE TABLE stats (
		id_stat_team_season BIGINT NOT NULL UNIQUE,
		team_id BIGINT NOT NULL,
		season_id BIGINT NOT NULL,
		gp INTEGER,
		w INTEGER,
		l INTEGER,
		win_percent FLOAT,
		minutes FLOAT,
		pts FLOAT,
		fgm FLOAT,
		fga FLOAT,
		fg_percent FLOAT,
		three_pm FLOAT,
		three_pa FLOAT,
		three_point_percent FLOAT,
		ftm FLOAT,
		fta FLOAT,
		ft_percent FLOAT,
		oreb FLOAT,
		dreb FLOAT,
		reb FLOAT,
		ast FLOAT,
		tov FLOAT,
		stl FLOAT,
		blk FLOAT,
		blka FLOAT,
		pf FLOAT,
		pfd FLOAT,
		plus_minus FLOAT,
		PRIMARY KEY (id_stat_team_season),
		CONSTRAINT `fk_stats_seasons`
			FOREIGN KEY (`season_id`)
			REFERENCES seasons (season_id) ON DELETE CASCADE ON UPDATE CASCADE,
		CONSTRAINT `fk_stats_teams`
			FOREIGN KEY (`team_id`)
			REFERENCES teams (team_id) ON DELETE CASCADE ON UPDATE CASCADE);

/* 2. Realizar la insercción de datos, en las tablas de la base de datos creada.
Os dejamos aquí los datos a introducir que necesitareis para insertar los datos en la BBDD.*/

	-- Al tratar de incluir los datos en las correspondientes tablas sale "Error Code 1452. Cannot add or update a child row: a foreign key 
	-- constraint fails" en relación a la constraint `fk_stats_seasons` porque en la tabla stats salen datos con un season_id = 140409122678064 
	-- que no aparece entre los datos de la tabla seasons.

	-- Para  solucionarlo se ha incluido el season_id mencionado en la tabla seasons con el tecto "NO IDENTIFICADA" en la columna season. Se 
	-- podría suponer que se trata de datos de la temporada 2018-2019 pero se considera que de esta manera se mantiene mejor la trazabilidad 
	-- de los datos hasta poder confirmar que efectivamente corresponden a dicha temporada.
